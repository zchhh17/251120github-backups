  "message": "fix(worker): improve websocket reconnection and error handling for stability

Fixes frequent WebSocket 1011 errors caused by reconnection logic and
data buffering issues in the Cloudflare Workers VLESS implementation.

- Unifies data handling to always use Uint8Array for socket writes
- Improves reconnection logic to use status 1000 (normal close) instead
  of 1011 (internal error), with proper state checks
- Removes unnecessary buffering and retransmission during reconnections
- Adds safer error handling, refined timers and backoff delay

These changes reduce internal error disconnects and significantly
improve connection reliability with v2rayN clients.",
