  "message": "perf(worker): optimize performance for websocket stream handling and reduce allocations

This change improves execution speed and memory usage for websocket
proxy connections on Cloudflare Workers by minimizing unnecessary object
allocations and stream writer handling. Key improvements include:

- Pre-compute UUID bytes for faster and lighter ID validation on every packet
- Reuse TextEncoder/TextDecoder instances and avoid per-request allocations
- Correctly manage release and reuse of stream writers for outbound and UDP flows
- Streamline header/payload concatenation in both TCP and UDP response paths
- Ensure `getOrder()` always returns array for proper iteration

Users can expect better throughput and lower latency, especially under load. No breaking changes.",
